# HackerRank Solutions in Java

This repository contains solutions to various programming challenges on the HackerRank website, implemented in Java. As I am learning and solving HackerRank problems for Java, I am storing the solutions here to learn and help others. I hope this repository will be useful for Java developers looking to improve their problem-solving skills.

## Subdomains

The solutions are organized into folders corresponding to different Java subdomains of problems on HackerRank, including:

1. Introduction
2. Strings
3. BigNumber
4. Data Structures (collection, Hashset...etc)
5. Object Oriented Programming

It's worth noting that some of the solutions may not be optimal, and there may be other ways to solve the same problem. Therefore, it's always a good idea to compare your solution to others and try to optimize it further. If you got any other solution fill free to submit pull request with proper Classfile and Problem name.
